# Egg Consumption Demographics
🪺🥚🍳🍮

## Goal
I started this project in February 2025 when the bird flu shot up egg prices everywhere.
Hoping to find out more about how the egg shortage would impact consumers, I dived into <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx">CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a> that sheds light on what Americans eat.

## Findings
After filtering for food containing eggs (omelettes, hard-boiled, egg salad...), I found that most people consumed fewer eggs from 2013 to 2023, except the rich, whose family income was about five times or more than the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines/prior-hhs-poverty-guidelines-federal-register-references/2023-poverty-guidelines-computations">poverty threshold</a>. That means for a one-person family in 2023, their income was $14,580 x 5 = $72,900.
 
## Data Collection
All the datasets I used are in [docs](docs).
